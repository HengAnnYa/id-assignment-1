## Project Overview
The theme I have chosen for this project is virtual idols, specifically the VOCALOID character Hatsune Miku. VOCALOID is an artificial voice synthesizer software product used to provide vocals in songs. With Hatsune Miku being the most widely used voicebank and as an icon in internet culture, it can be hard for fans to keep up with her developments and overwhelming for new fans who may be unfamilar with the concept of VOCALOID. The website I plan to build aims to solve all of these problems for fans, functioning as a comprehensive fanpage with a clear layout for fans to easily access the information they want. 

## Design Process
Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
+ As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory) Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.

This website will primarily be for fans and users of Hatsune Miku, and have a wide variety of features to help them access more Miku related content. As Hatsune Miku is a virtual singer free for anyone to use, it may be hard to keep up with her various developments given her popularity and widespread influence which often results in collaborations or projects with different brands. As such, fans may find it hard or inconvenient to keep up and feel like they missed out on something which they may be interested in. This website hence aims to solve that by being where everything they may want to know would organised in one place and easy to follow, without having to check across multiple forums, making it more convenient and less frustrating experience. Another issue is the steadily declining fanbase of VOCALOID, where old fans are losing interest while not gaining new fans. This website also aims to solve this issue, through the use of ways to keep old fans engaged while also attracting new fans, through the inclusion of forums where fans can interact with like-minded people and build a community. I feel that my project is the best way to achieve this due to
