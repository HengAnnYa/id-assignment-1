## Project Overview
The theme I have chosen for this project is virtual idols, specifically the VOCALOID character Hatsune Miku. VOCALOID is an artificial voice synthesizer software product used to provide vocals in songs. With Hatsune Miku being the most widely used voicebank and as an icon in internet culture, it can be hard for fans to keep up with her developments and overwhelming for new fans who may be unfamilar with the concept of VOCALOID. The website I plan to build aims to solve all of these problems for fans, functioning as a comprehensive fanpage with a clear layout for fans to easily access the information they want. 

## Design Process
Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
+ As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory) Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.
