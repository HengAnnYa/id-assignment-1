## Project Overview
The theme I have chosen for this project is virtual idols, specifically the VOCALOID character Hatsune Miku. VOCALOID is an artificial voice synthesizer software product used to provide vocals in songs. This website will primarily be for fans and users of Hatsune Miku. As Hatsune Miku is a virtual singer free for anyone to use, it may be hard to keep up with her various developments given her popularity and widespread influence which often results in collaborations or projects with different brands. As such, fans may find it hard or inconvenient to keep up and feel like they missed out on something which they may be interested in. This website hence aims to solve that by being where everything they may want to know would organised in one place and easy to follow, without having to check across multiple forums, making it a more convenient and less frustrating experience. Another issue is the steadily declining fanbase of VOCALOID, where old fans are losing interest while not gaining new fans. This website also aims to solve this issue by keeping old fans engaged while also attracting new fans through the inclusion of forums where fans can interact with like-minded people and build a community. Due to VOCALOID being a software that can be used by anyone, there also many individuals who use Hatsune Miku to make music. Unfortunately, this makes it harder for many talented individuals to gain recognition for their work. This website hence also aims to be a place where music producers can easily promote their work to fans, increasing their visibility. 

## Design Process
This website would primarily be for both fans of Hatsune Miku and those who use her to make music, as a means for fans to easily access related content and for music producers to promote their work to more people. I feel that my project is the best way to achieve this due to it having many useful features and everything being in one place. This will in turn hopefully draw in more fans to use the platform, which would in turn benefit music producers who use VOCALOID as their songs have a greater chance of reaching the community.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory) Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.
